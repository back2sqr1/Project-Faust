\section{Overview}

There are four main categories of concepts in the book. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Predictive learning: The goal is to predict a continuous and valued phenomenon (this can also be a form of distinguishing of different objects)
  \item Feature Design: Using tools and techniques to make more successful predictive models
  \item Function approximation: The goal is to approximate a function that is not known (implying there is little to learn from the proper features themselves)
  \item Numerical Optimization - powering the first three and makes machine learning run
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Toy Example: Cats and Dogs} 
\problem{What is the goal and solution of the Cats and Dogs problem?} 


\answer{The goal is to be able to correctly distinguish between cats and dogs given new pictures and new samples of data.} 

\solution{Find features that differentiate between cats and dogs (numerical) and divide them with a line}

\subsection{Classication: }

Similar to regression, the key difference between the two is instead of prediction of a continuous valued output
classification aims to predict values to take on discrete values or classes.
