The goal is to get smarter. My notes serve to find showcase how much I've learned. I believe books are still the best way to learn, and I only hope for reading that can satisfy an entire career.

Reading List:

Motion Planning by Steven Lavelle (finish by the semester)
Practical Vim
Numerical Methods 
Physically Based Rendering

The goal is to go slow and steady.
