\section{Overview}

There are four main categories of concepts in the book. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Predictive learning: The goal is to predict a continuous and valued phenomenon (this can also be a form of distinguishing of different objects)
  \item Feature Design: Using tools and techniques to make more successful predictive models
  \item Function approximation: The goal is to approximate a function that is not known (implying there is little to learn from the proper features themselves)
  \item Numerical Optimization - powering the first three and makes machine learning run
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Toy Example: Cats and Dogs} 
\problem{Sample Title}{This is a sample problem. Add more details here.}{1}

\section{Main Section}

We begin by describing the problem \ldots.
Make sure to use sections and subsections.

\subsection{Blah blah blah}
Here is a subsection.

\subsubsection{Blah blah blah}
Here is a subsubsection. You can use these as well.

\subsection{Using Boldface}
Make sure to use lots of boldface.

\paragraph{Question:}
How would you use boldface?

\paragraph{Example:}
This is an example showing how to use boldface to 
help organize your topics.


\paragraph{Some Formatting.}
Here is some formatting that you can use in your notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Item One} -- This is the first item.
\item {\em Item Two} -- This is the second item.
\item \dots and here are other items.
\end{itemize}

If you need to number things, you can use this style:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Item One} -- Again, this is the first item.
\item {\em Item Two} -- Again, this is the second item.
\item \dots and here are other items.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Bibliography.}
Please give real bibliographical citations for the papers that we
mention in class. See below for how to include a bibliography section.
If you use BibTeX, integrate the .bbl file into your .tex
source. You should reference papers like this: ``The FKS
dictionary originates in a paper by Fredman, Koml\'{o}s and
Szemer\'{e}di \cite{fks}.'' In general, the name of the authors should
appear in text at most once (for the first citation); further
citations look like: ``Our proof follows that of \cite{fks}''.

Take a look at previous topics (TeX files are available) to see the
details. A excellent source for bibliographical citations is
DBLP. Just Google DBLP and an author's name.
